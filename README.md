# genyman vscode extension

An extension for Microsoft Visual Code (vscode) that uses a context menu in the explorer, or a command to run `genyman` with the current / selected file.

## Known Issues

Currently it creates a terminal window everytime your run; meaning you get x 'genyman' terminals after a while.
HELP NEEDED -> I just want the same terminal again for every run. Or a better way to execute the command.

## Release Notes

Not released at the moment because of the above issues.
